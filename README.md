# Project Online Web Store app tests
(test planning, manual test execution, and bug reporting)

System environment 

- The Store has two active actors and one cooperating system. All of them are accessing their parts from the Internet. The Unregistered user can access the basic functionality of the project. One can view products and pictures. The Registered user can access some of the basic CRUD operations over the orders. One can create an order, edit its own orders, add and remove details from it.
